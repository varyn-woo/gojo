# gojo
Go server for handling glorious ducksu backend.

## Dependencies
- [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Install Gin](github.com/gin-gonic/gin) (HTTP server library)
- [Install Cors](github.com/gin-contrib/cors) (add-on middleware to handle CORS preflight HTTP requests)

## Running the Server
To run the server, `cd` into the directory, then `go run server.go`.

Currently, both Glorious Ducksu and Gojo run locally, so they must be run on the same machine to talk to each other. This will (obviously) be fixed as we work on the project.
